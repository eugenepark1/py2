How many ways can we award a 1st, 2nd and 3rd place prize among eight contestants? (Gold / Silver / Bronze)

Gold medal: 8 choices: A B C D E F G H (Clever how I made the names match up with letters, eh?). Let’s say A wins the Gold.
Silver medal: 7 choices: B C D E F G H. Let’s say B wins the silver.
Bronze medal: 6 choices: C D E F G H. Let’s say… C wins the bronze.

We picked certain people to win, but the details don’t matter: 
	we had 8 choices at first, then 7, then 6. The total number of options was 8 · 7 · 6 = 336.

P(n,k) = n! / (n-k)!

You have n items and want to find the number of ways k items can be ordered:

How many ways can I give 3 tin cans to 8 people?
So, if we have 3 tin cans to give away, there are 3! or 6 variations for every choice we pick.


C(n,k) = n! / (n-k)! k!

C(8, 3) =     8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1         8*7*6         56
              (8-3)! 3!               3*2*1

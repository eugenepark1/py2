topological sort
	topological sorting of vertices of a Directed Acyclic Graph is an ordering of the vertices v1, v2,...vn in such a way, 
	that if there is an edge directed towards vertex vj from vertex vi, then vi comes before vj
	
	(1) -> (2)   ->  (4) 
	    -> (3)   ->  
	                  ->  (5)

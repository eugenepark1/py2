abstract class
	Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods. 
	An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. 
	Abstract classes may not be instantiated, and require subclasses to provide implementations for the abstract methods.
	
Encapsulation - The wrapping up of data and functions into a single unit (i.e. class) is commonly referred to as Encapsulation.
	Example. A human body is a single unit (i.e. class) with multiple systems within it to run properly like nervous system, circulatory system etc.

Abstraction - The mechanism of representing essential features without including the background details is referred to as abstraction.
	Example. A driver of a car is more interested in driving a car rather than focusing on how the engine is working etc.

1. Abstraction is generalised term while Encapsulation is subset of Abstraction.
2.Abstraction solves the problem in design level while Encapsulation solves in implementation level.
3.Abstraction hides unwanted data and gives relevent data while Encapsulation hides code and data into a single unit to protect from outside world.
4.Abstraction is Outer layout while Encapsulation is Inner layout.
5.Abstraction is used in terms of design while Encapsulation used in terms of implementation. 

Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

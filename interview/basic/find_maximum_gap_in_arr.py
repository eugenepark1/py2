Leetcode: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

# O(nlogn)

        i += 1; j -= 1

    sell = sorted_days[j]
    print 'Buy on day', buy, A[buy]
    print 'Sell on day', sell, A[sell]

Leetcode: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
'''

# X = d-a; Y = (b-a) + (d-c) then X < Y
# Compute the difference between each two consecutive days, select positive values

            # finish previous transaction
            if sell > buy and A[sell] - A[buy] > 0:
                transactions.append((buy, sell))
